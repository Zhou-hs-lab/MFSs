# MFSs
This R software package used GSVA to calculate the enrichment abundance of 85 metabolic pathways through transcriptome data of new samples, and based on the metabolic-feature-based subtypes (MFSs) and enrichment abundance of 85 metabolic pathways of the built-in training set, the new samples were classified as MFS1, or MFS2 or MFS3.
